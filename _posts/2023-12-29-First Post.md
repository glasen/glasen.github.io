title: First post on github-pages
---

This is my first post on my Github Pages-based blog. I have retired my old WordPress-based blog. The main reason was that it became too cumbersome for me to maintain the installation. I also no longer wanted to pay â‚¬3 a month for the root server.

I also decided to write in English. Thanks to DeepL, this is no longer a major problem and I can reach an international audience. The focus of my blog is also changing a little. While in the past I have mainly written about Linux topics, especially Ubuntu, I am now also focusing on other topics.

One example will be an article about a file format from digital forensics and the problems I encounter every day as a software developer in this environment.
